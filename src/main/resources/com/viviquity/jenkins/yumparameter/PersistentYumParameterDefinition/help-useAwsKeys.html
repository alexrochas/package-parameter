    <p>If you need to access the repository outside of the repository, you will need grant access to the S3 bucket.</p>
    <p>When accessing it from within AWS, it's probable that the server itself provides the necessary access rights.</p>
    <p>
        When accessing it from outside, you need to provide a key pair. These are set up in the AWS admin console.
        If you don't have access, please ask operations to create a new key pair with access to the specified bucket.
    </p>
